1. The first big design change was my addition of the TrainTraffic class. This class is an Observable. The initial problem I was facing with trying to get the gates to close in time was that they could only be notified by one train at a time. We have no control when the notifications actually take place so I "grouped" the trains together is TrainTraffic which serves as a container for the trains.  The move method in this class moves both trains along and when that happens it lets its observers (the gates know). 
The second big change I made was by adding a class called TJunction. I have mixed feelings about my implementation of this. I was debating between making traffic along a road observable so another class would handle adding cars to different car obeservables, and creating logical segments in the roads. I went with creating logical segments in the road. In the old design there was no way to know if you were approaching an intersection. In my design each segment has a queue named for the direction is it in. That way when a car is coming down the NE portion of the highway I can quickly in in O(1) get the last car on one of the other highways to make it an observable.
