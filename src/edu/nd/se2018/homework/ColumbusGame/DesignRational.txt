I think the observer pattern is a nice way to have objects keep track of the behavior of another object of interest. It was very clear to understand where and how to get what variables to what class since a lot of things were handled by OceanExplorer. To be able to implement the stretch suggestions, I would simply have functions available to clear all the important data structure and all the state of the previous game with disappear with it conviently. The number of islands for example is saved as a variable, so it would be no problem to clear the current ocean map and create a new map with n islands. I feel replacing the islands with images is straightforward as well. I would upload an image like for the Ship, and create a similar grid. From my understand ing JavaFx the Rectangle behaves exactly like an image in this context.
